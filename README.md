# Rest::Easy

Building a REST API — even with Rails — is tedious work. This project aims to eliminate all that tedious work by providing the generic boilerplate functionality that all APIs require so that you can start building out your custom business logic right away.

This project is highly inspired by ideas and concepts found in the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api), and aims to allow you to build APIs of similar quality with as little work as possible.
